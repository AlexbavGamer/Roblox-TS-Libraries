# Yield for Character Parts

Usage:

Pass a Player's Character `Model` into `yieldForR15CharacterDescendants` or `yieldForR6CharacterDescendants`, which will yield via `WaitForChild` until all the members defined in the code exist (all members except those generated by Sound/Animate scripts). Once these members exist, the function will return the Model with the member children defined.

```ts
// All of these members are properly typed and defined!
yieldForR15CharacterDescendants(character).Head.face.Texture = ""
```

Meant to be used with [rbx-safe-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rbx-safe-types), although it should also work with rbx-types.
